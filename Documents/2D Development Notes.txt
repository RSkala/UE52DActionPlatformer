2D / Paper 2D / Paper ZD Notes

=================================

=============
General Notes
=============

-------------------------------------------------------
Projects:
* UE5PlatformerProj is the initial test project and will not be actively used
* MegaActionPlatformer is the actual project used (the 2D action platformer, created from a Blank project)

-------------------------------------------------------
Editor Convenience Settings:
* Editor Preferences
 * ->General->Appearance->User Interface->Asset Editor Open Location: Main Window
 * Level Editor - Viewports->Controls->Orbit Camera Around Selection:  ENABLED

Default Map:
* Project Settings->Maps & Modes->Default Maps
  * Editor Startup Map
  * Game Default Map

Selected Camera Preview in Viewport:
* Editor Preferences -> Level Editor - Viewports
  * Camera Preview Size (Default is 5.0). Reduce size to shrink in Viewport
  * Preview Selected Cameras:
    *If disabled the camera preview will not show up when a camera is selected.

* https://www.unrealdirective.com/resources/asset-naming-conventions
  * Contains 2D elements such as Sprite (SPR_)

-------------------------------------------------------
2D Project Settings

Anti-Aliasing
* Project Settings->Engine->Rendering->Anti-Aliasing Method
  * None: Best for 2D-only games
  * FXAA: Best for 2D/3D hybrid games

Motion Blur
* Project Settings->Engine->Rendering->Default Settings->Motion Blur
  * DISABLED: Best for all games

Pixels Per Unit:
* Project Settings->Editor->Paper2D - Import->New Asset Settings
  * Default Pixels Per Unreal Unit: 1.0
  * 0.25 is a good setting to make a 2D character a good size

NOTES ON PPU:
* 1 Unreal Unit = 1 cm (0.032ft)
  * So, 32px @ 1PPU    => 32cm  (1.04ft)
  *     32px @ 0.25PPU => 128cm (4.2ft)
        * (this means a 32px character will be 4 times as large compared to 1ppu)
* We want to change this value because the Character Movement Component expects the character to be of reasonable height (i.e. human-sized)

A 32px character @ 1PPU is 32cm high (since 1 Unreal Unit = 1cm)
32 cm ~ 1.04ft
Changing to 0.25 means a 32px character would be 4 times as large compared to 1PPY
A 32px character @ 0.25PPU is 128cm high
128cm ~ 4.2ft
-------------------------------------------------------
Texture Settings:

* Right-click the texture in the Content Browser:
  * Sprite Actions->Apply Paper2D Texture Settings

* This changes various settings best for pixel art, e.g.
  * Mip Gen Settings -> NoMipMaps
  * Texture Group -> 2D Pixels (unfiltered)

-------------------------------------------------------
Extracting Sprites from Texture Sheet:

* Right-click->Sprite Actions->Extract Sprites
  * Note that sprites will often be different sizes, which is what we dont want, so:
  * Sprite Extract Mode:
    * Change from Auto to Grid
    * You then need to set the Cell Width and Cell Height

-------------------------------------------------------
World Partition / OFPA
* OFPA = "One File Per Actor"
* UE5.4 added a "World Partitioning" by default
* This creates a huge number of oddly named assets, meant for the purpose of multiple developers working on the same level.
* This is not helpful for one person or a small team

Disabling World Partition / OFPA:
* In the current map, go to World Settings:
  * World Partition Setup->World Partition: SET THIS TO NONE
  * World->Advanced->Use External Actors:  TURN THIS OFF

Confirm this is disabled:
* Open World Partition window: Window->World Partition Editor
* A message should display there: "World Partition is disabled for this map"


Solution Reference:

https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/disable-one-file-per-actor/658398/3
Solution is in a comment:

The tool in question didnâ€™t exist for me, however I was able to disable External Actors by first disabling World Partition via the World Outliner, then just uncheck the External Actors checkbox from the World Outliner as well.

NOTE:
* The ThirdPersonMap starts with this enabled (that is, the default map for the Third Person Template).
* If you just create a new map, it will be "normal" without ExternalActors and ExternalObjects enabled.


-------------------------------------------------------
Overlap Events for Components on an Actor:
* Select component, e.g. collision Sphere
  * Details->Events->OnComponentBeginOverlap, click + to create an Event
  * Details->Collision->Collision Presets->OverlapAllDynamic

-------------------------------------------------------
Tips:
* Alt + Drag an Actor in the scene to make a copy

Paper2D / PaperZD:
* PaperZD is built on top of Paper2D and adds more functionality, such as Anim Notifies

===========================================
Project Settings

PaperZD Plugin: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/paperzd

===========================================
Sprites Settings:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Normal Process for Creating Sprite Sheets and Sprite Animations:

Single Sprite Sheet:
* Right-click->Sprite Actions->Apply Paper2D Texture Settings
* Right-click->Extract Sprites
* Sprite Extract Mode: Grid
  * Cell Width:  240/6  = 40
  * Cell Height: 532/14 = 38
    * Note that you can actually type the division symbol / in the text box to get the value!
* Click "Extract"
  * If whitespace sprites are created, they can be deleted.


Create an Animation from Sprites:
* Select sprites from extracted sprites:
  * Right-click -> Create Flipbook
  * In Flipbook, can set Frames Per Second for the animation

----------------------------------------------------------------
Faster / Better Sprite Workflow:

JSON Method
* Note: This is the method used for the project
* When using Aseprite, you will get a JSON file alongside the PNG
* Drag ONLY the JSON file into the project
  * This will automatically import the PNG that is next to it.
  * If you drag BOTH, you will get various warnings (because it doesnt need the source PNG)
    * NOTE: The error doesnt matter, you can still (and should) drag entire folders when needed
* After dragging the JSON into the project, a file and two directories will be created:
  * <same name as the json/png>: PaperSpriteSheet asset ("player" in this project)
  * Frames:  Folder containing all the frames already cut out and named
  * Textures: Original Texture with Paper2D texture settings applied
    

* You can then Right-click the sprite sheet and then Create Flipbooks
  * This will create everything you already need and set up!
  * Note that single-frame Flipbooks still and should be created!

* Also note that we have to set the Frames Per Second values manually!
  * For this project we will set all of Flipbooks' FPS values to 7.0.

* To quickly edit multiple assets at the same time.
  * Shift-click the assets -> right-click -> Asset Actions -> Edit Selection in Property Matrix

---
Enemies:
* Added entire Enemies folder

NOTE:
* Bug in Packaged Game regarding Paper 2D Texture Settings.
* Apparently for standard "Texture" assets, even though "Default (from Texture Group)" SHOULD be applied (and in fact it IS in the editor), this settings may not be applied in a Packaged game.
* Apply a Textures in the Content Browser -> Right Click -> Asset Actions -> Edit Selection in Property Matrix to bulk edit
* In Texture -> Filter -> Set all to Nearest (which I think is the same thing)


===============================================
20. Inheritance and making the Player Blueprint

* We are creating characters from PaperZDCharacter as the base class.
* I created a C++ base class:
  class MEGAACTIONPLATFORMER_API AActionCharBase : public APaperZDCharacter

Setting the Character Sprite:
* In the Blueprint Viewport, select the Sprite Component
  * -> Sprite -> Source Flipbook

Change the size of the collision capsule:
* In the Blueprint Viewport, select the Capsule Component
  * -> Shape -> Capsule Half Height

To Cast Shadows (for 2D/3D hybrid)
* Blueprint Viewport, select the Sprite Component
  * -> Lighting -> Cast Shadow : Enabled
* In the map, you will need to move and/or rotate the Directional Light (the sun)
  * Change the rotation so you can see where the shadow lies

To Receive Shadow (for 2D/3D hybrid)
* This is a material setting
* Blueprint Viewport, select Sprite Component
  * -> Materials -> Default for Sprites is MaskedUnlitSpriteMaterial (i.e. for 2D only games)
  * Change Material to MaskedLitSpriteMaterial
    * If this material is not showing up:
      * Click the cog icon and make sure "Show Plugin Content" is selected
      * This material is part of the Paper2D plugin (not ZD)


Create a Child of the BP_ActionChar_BASE Blueprint:
* Select the Blueprint in the Content Browser -> Right click -> Create Child Blueprint Class
  BP_Player

===============================================
21. Possessing the Player and Camera Setup

Create a GameMode
* Right click -> New Blueprint Class -> GameModeBase (or your own GameMode class)

Use the player pawn:
* Open the GameMode Blueprint -> Details -> Classes -> Default Pawn Class

Use the Game Mode:
* Edit -> Project Settings -> Project -> Maps & Modes -> Default Modes -> Default GameMode
  * Also can override this in a map:
    * World Settings -> Game Mode -> GameMode Override

Adding a Camera to the player character:
* In the Blueprint Viewport, select the Capsule Component (not the Sprite or anything else!)
  * Click Add -> Spring Arm
  * Select the new Spring Arm -> Add -> Camera
  * Position the Spring Arm for 2D:
    * Spring Arm -> Details
      * Rotate around Z (Yaw) so it is facing so X-right and Z-up (-90 degree rotation)
      * Camera -> Target Arm Length = 500
      * Also we set the Y (Pitch) angle to -15
  * Turn collision off the spring arm (in case an object goes between to block)
    * Spring Arm -> Details -> Camera Collision -> Do Collision Test: DISABLED

===============================================
22. Setting Up Inputs and Movement

Enhanced Input System
* Note that since UE5.1 and on, this is now the default input system
  * Check in Project Settings -> Engine -> Input -> Default Classes
    * Default Player Input Class:     EnhancedPlayerInput
    * Default Input Component Class:  EnhancedInputComponent

Classes Needed for Input:
* Input Action
* Input Mapping Context

Content Browser -> Right Click -> Input -> Input Action / Input Mapping Context

Input Action:
* Value Type
  * Bool: A button that is pressed or not impressed
  * Axis 1D: float - A -1 or +1 value, (e.g. Left or Right)
  * Axis 2D: Vector2D (e.g. Left, Right, Up, Down)
  * Axis 3D: motion controller or smart phone

This game moves only left and right, so we just want Axis1D for movement
* IA_Jump, IA_Move

Input Mapping Context:
* Need to "Bind" the Input Actions to a button
* When mapping to axis/movement, for an Axis1D the default direction is RIGHT
* For an Axis1D, for LEFT, you must add a NEGATE Modifier

To USE the Inputs:
* Open the player Blueprint

Add the Input Mapping Context:
* Event Graph, On BeginPlay:
  * Get Controller, Cast to PlayerController, from the PlayerController:
    * Get Enhanced Input Local Player Subsystem -> Add Mapping Context
      * Set the Input Mapping Context for your game (e.g. IMC_Action)

Implement the Input Actions:
* Event Graph, Right-click:
  * Input -> Enhanced Action Events (this will populate with the Input Actions, e.g. IA_Jump)
    * Triggered: For button continously pressed
    * Started:   For button press down
    * Canceled:  For button press release

Note: We set IA_Jump -> Started to "Jump" which is a premade function on the Character class

For Movement:
* e.g. IA_Move -> Enhanced Input Action:
* The Character class has a function "Add Movement Input"
* Get the "Action Value" pin, which will be [-1, +1] (could be in between for joystick input)
  * Set the Action Value to the Scale Value of "Add Movement Input"
* IMPORTANT: We also need to set the "World Direction"
  * For this platformer game, movement is only in the X, so we can set World Direction to:
    (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

Player Facing Direction
* Use Get Controller -> Set Control Rotation
  * Drag back from "New Rotation" pin -> Utilities -> Select
    * Use "Action Value", check if >= 0
      * True : moving right, Make Rotator: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 
      * False: moving left, Make Rotator:  0.0, 180.0. 0.0
        * This means, 180 degrees in the Yaw (rotation around Z-axis), so the asset is flipped

With the above, the Camera ALSO flips around, which we DONT want:
* In the BP_Player's Viewport, select the SpringArm:
  * Details -> Transform
    * Change Rotation to World (which changes it to "Absolute Rotation")
      * This means it will always keep this rotation and ignore what its parent does
    * Note: In the comments, you could also set Disable Inherit Yaw, but that may cause bugs whenthe player dies and/or detaches. It is best to use Absolute Rotation here.


===============================================
4.23. Setting Up Animations with PaperZD

3 Types of PaperZD assets that can be created:
* Animation Sequence
* Animation Source
* PaperZD AnimBP

Animation Source
* Always create this first
* Basically a "collection" of all your Flipbooks you want to use with a Character
* You have to manually add each one, name, and set the Flipbook
* This creates AnimationSequence assets for each in an AnimSequences folder

Animation Sequence:
* Created from Animation Source (as above)

PaperZD AnimBP
* Right-click->Paper ZD->PaperZD Anim BP
* You have to select a parent Animation Source
  * We generally give these an ABP_ prefix (e.g. ABP_Player)
* In EventGraph, OnInit, you need to get the Owning Actor and set the OwningPlayer
  * GetOwningPlyer->Cast to BP_Player -> Set OwningPlayer (create variable)
* AnimGraph:
  * Where we set up all our animations
  * Output Animation node will determine the final state of our animation
  * Drag off from the little man icon and under the Animation section:
    * You can see all of your AnimSequence assets

Set the PaperZD AnimBP in a PaperZDCharacter class:
* Select the AnimationComponent -> Paper ZD -> Anim Instance Class
  * Set this to your PaperZD AnimBP (e.g. ABP_Player)

-------------------------
PaperZD AnimBP:

StateMachine:
* In a PZDABP's's AnimGraph, Right-click->State Machine->Add New State Machine
* You can have multiple StateMachines (e.g. Swimming, Flying, etc)
* Drag off a node to create a Transition to a new animation state 
  * A Transition looks like a white circle with two arrows pointing between the two nodes
  * Double-click a transition node to add logic
  * Drag back into the other node to create a transition back (e.g. Idle->Run, Run->Idle)

===============================================
4.24 Improving Character Movement

Since this is a 2D game with 3D backgrounds, we need to ensure physics do not "push" Characters outside of the "lane":

Plane Constraints:
* Select the base class character -> Character Movement Component -> Planar Movement
 * -> Constrain to Plane:  ENABLED
 * -> Plane Constraint Normal:  Set Y to 1.0 (X and Z should stay at 0.0)
      * We DONT want to move in the Y axis at all
      * This constrains movement to the XZ plane
      * This sets the Plane Constraint Normal to (0,1,0) and the Plane Constraint Origin to (0,0,0)

Walking Off Edges
* Character Movement Component -> Character Movement: Walking
  * -> Use Flat Base for Floor Checks:  ENABLED
    * This ignores the bottom "rounded" part of the capsule collision
    * When walking near an edge, the character will "slide" down the edge because of the rounded base of the capsule collision. This setting fixes that.
    * However, when dealing with slopes or stairs, this will be a problem and wont be addressed in this project.

Jumping Settings:
* Character Movement Component
  * Character Movement (General Settings):
    * Gravity Scale: Changed from 1 to 3
  * Character Movement: Jumping / Falling:
    * Jump Z Velocity: Changed from 420 cm/s to 900
    * Air Control: Changed from 0.05 to 0.7
      * Note: "1" would be the same amount of control we have while on the ground

===============================================
