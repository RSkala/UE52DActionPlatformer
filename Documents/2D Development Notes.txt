2D / Paper 2D / Paper ZD Notes

=================================

=============
General Notes
=============

-------------------------------------------------------
Projects:
* UE5PlatformerProj is the initial test project and will not be actively used
* MegaActionPlatformer is the actual project used (the 2D action platformer, created from a Blank project)

-------------------------------------------------------
Editor Convenience Settings:
* Editor Preferences
 * ->General->Appearance->User Interface->Asset Editor Open Location: Main Window
 * Level Editor - Viewports->Controls->Orbit Camera Around Selection:  ENABLED

Default Map:
* Project Settings->Maps & Modes->Default Maps
  * Editor Startup Map
  * Game Default Map

-------------------------------------------------------
Asset Naming Conventions / Style Guides

* https://www.unrealdirective.com/resources/asset-naming-conventions
  * Contains 2D elements such as Sprite (SPR_)

-------------------------------------------------------
2D Project Settings

Anti-Aliasing
* Project Settings->Engine->Rendering->Anti-Aliasing Method
  * None: Best for 2D-only games
  * FXAA: Best for 2D/3D hybrid games

Motion Blur
* Project Settings->Engine->Rendering->Default Settings->Motion Blur
  * DISABLED: Best for all games

Pixels Per Unit:
* Project Settings->Editor->Paper2D - Import->New Asset Settings
  * Default Pixels Per Unreal Unit: 1.0
  * 0.25 is a good setting to make a 2D character a good size

NOTES ON PPU:
* 1 Unreal Unit = 1 cm (0.032ft)
  * So, 32px @ 1PPU    => 32cm  (1.04ft)
  *     32px @ 0.25PPU => 128cm (4.2ft)
        * (this means a 32px character will be 4 times as large compared to 1ppu)
* We want to change this value because the Character Movement Component expects the character to be of reasonable height (i.e. human-sized)

A 32px character @ 1PPU is 32cm high (since 1 Unreal Unit = 1cm)
32 cm ~ 1.04ft
Changing to 0.25 means a 32px character would be 4 times as large compared to 1PPY
A 32px character @ 0.25PPU is 128cm high
128cm ~ 4.2ft

-------------------------------------------------------
World Partition / OFPA
* OFPA = "One File Per Actor"
* UE5.4 added a "World Partitioning" by default
* This creates a huge number of oddly named assets, meant for the purpose of multiple developers working on the same level.
* This is not helpful for one person or a small team

Disabling World Partition / OFPA:
* In the current map, go to World Settings:
  * World Partition Setup->World Partition: SET THIS TO NONE
  * World->Advanced->Use External Actors:  TURN THIS OFF

Confirm this is disabled:
* Open World Partition window: Window->World Partition Editor
* A message should display there: "World Partition is disabled for this map"


Solution Reference:

https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/disable-one-file-per-actor/658398/3
Solution is in a comment:

The tool in question didnâ€™t exist for me, however I was able to disable External Actors by first disabling World Partition via the World Outliner, then just uncheck the External Actors checkbox from the World Outliner as well.

NOTE:
* The ThirdPersonMap starts with this enabled (that is, the default map for the Third Person Template).
* If you just create a new map, it will be "normal" without ExternalActors and ExternalObjects enabled.


-------------------------------------------------------
Overlap Events for Components on an Actor:
* Select component, e.g. collision Sphere
  * Details->Events->OnComponentBeginOverlap, click + to create an Event
  * Details->Collision->Collision Presets->OverlapAllDynamic

-------------------------------------------------------
Tips:
* Alt + Drag an Actor in the scene to make a copy

Paper2D / PaperZD:
* PaperZD is built on top of Paper2D and adds more functionality, such as Anim Notifies
