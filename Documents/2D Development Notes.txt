2D / Paper 2D / Paper ZD Notes

General Notes
=============

-------------------------------------------------------
Projects:
* UE5PlatformerProj is the initial test project and will not be actively used
* MegaActionPlatformer is the actual project used (the 2D action platformer, created from a Blank project)

-------------------------------------------------------
World Partition / OFPA
* OFPA = "One File Per Actor"
* UE5.4 added a "World Partitioning" by default
* This creates a huge number of oddly named assets, meant for the purpose of multiple developers working on the same level.
* This is not helpful for one person or a small team

Disabling World Partition / OFPA:
* In the current map, go to World Settings:
  * World Partition Setup->World Partition: SET THIS TO NONE
  * World->Advanced->Use External Actors:  TURN THIS OFF

Confirm this is disabled:
* Open World Partition window: Window->World Partition Editor
* A message should display there: "World Partition is disabled for this map"

Solution is in a comment:

The tool in question didnâ€™t exist for me, however I was able to disable External Actors by first disabling World Partition via the World Outliner, then just uncheck the External Actors checkbox from the World Outliner as well.

NOTE:
* The ThirdPersonMap starts with this enabled (that is, the default map for the Third Person Template).
* If you just create a new map, it will be "normal" without ExternalActors and ExternalObjects enabled.


-------------------------------------------------------
Overlap Events for Components on an Actor:
* Select component, e.g. collision Sphere
  * Details->Events->OnComponentBeginOverlap, click + to create an Event
  * Details->Collision->Collision Presets->OverlapAllDynamic

-------------------------------------------------------
Tips:
* Alt + Drag an Actor in the scene to make a copy

Paper2D / PaperZD:
* PaperZD is built on top of Paper2D and adds more functionality, such as Anim Notifies
